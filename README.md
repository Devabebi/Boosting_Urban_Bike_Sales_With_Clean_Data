# Boosting_Urban_Bike_Sales_With_Clean_Data
In this project I help Urban Cycles clean their inconsistent sales report data sourced from their multiple branches and online transactions
The cleaned data enhances accuracy for demand forecasting, inventory control, and strategic business decisions.
The Clean data prevent from overstocking or understocking of bikes, missed sales opportunities, and inefficient resource allocation.
