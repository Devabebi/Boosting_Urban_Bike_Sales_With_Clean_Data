## Business Overview

Urban Cycles is a growing bicycle retail company that operates both physical stores and an online platform across America. The company specializes in selling a wide range of bicycles including mountain bikes, road bikes, hybrid models, and electric bikes, catering to diverse customer needs from casual riders to cycling enthusiasts. 

With a strong emphasis on quality and customer service , Urban Cycles has positioned itself as a customer centric brand offering value for money. The company has seen consistent growth over the past few years and is aiming to expand its market reach and customer base even further.

To support its growth goals, Urban Cycles relies heavily on accurate and reliable sales data to make strategic decisions around inventory management, marketing campaigns, and performance tracking across regions and sales channels


## Problem Statement

Recently, Urban Cycles has encountered major inconsistencies in their sales reports . These reports are sourced from multiple branches and online transactions, but the lack of standardized data entry and inconsistent formatting has made the reports difficult to analyze and trust.

The implications of this problem are significant. It affects the companyâ€™s ability to accurately measure performance, forecast demand, and make informed business decisions. Poor data quality could lead to overstocking or understocking of bikes, missed sales opportunities, and inefficient resource allocation


## Project Rationale

- **1** A key reason for this project is to **enhance data accuracy and reliability.** Clean, well structured sales data ensures that management can **trust the numbers** theyâ€™re using to make **important business decisions.** Without this, even the most well designed strategies may be based on misleading or incorrect insights
  
- **2** This project supports **efficiency in data analysis and reporting**. Cleaning and standardising the dataset allows for **faster generation of insights, automated dashboards, and consistent** reporting across all branches and platforms saving time and reducing human error.
  
- **3** Improving data quality lays the foundation for **scaling business intelligence efforts**. As Urban Cycles grows, theyâ€™ll need **cleaner data for more advanced analytics** like sales forecasting, customer segmentation, and performance tracking. This project sets the stage for deeper and more impactful **data driven strategies.**


## Aim of the Project

- **1** Identify and correct **missing or incomplete values** in key fields such as customer contact information, bike type, and sales data.
- **2** **Standardize data entries** across the dataset, ensuring consistency in data formats and categories.
- **3** **Remove duplicate records** that may distort sales figures or customer counts.
- **4** **Split or combine fields** where necessary (e.g., separating full names into first and last names).
- **5** **Prepare the cleaned dataset** for analysis by making it suitable for summary reports, pivot tables, and visual dashboards in Excel.

## Project Workflow

- **Step 1:** BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING:
I begun by understanding Urban Cyclesâ€™ goals and the challenges caused by poor data quality. Clarify how clean data supports decision making in sales, marketing, and inventory planning.

- **Step 2:** DATA UNDERSTANDING
I reviewed the raw dataset to get familiar with its structure, identify key fields, and observe common issues such as missing values, inconsistent formats, and duplicates.

- **Step 3:** DATA PREPARATION (CLEANING)
I cleaned and prepare the data using Excel. This includes removing duplicates, standardizing entries, formatting fields, fixing calculations, and addressing missing or
inconsistent values.

- **Step 4:** DATA ANALYSIS 
I proned further to perform basic summary statistics and pivot tables to verify data quality and show initial insights such as total sales by category, age group distribution, or revenue by state.

- **Step 5:** DELIVERABLE PREPARATION
I presented a clean, analysis ready dataset along with a summary of steps taken. Ensure the dataset is suitable for dashboards, reporting, or further analysis using Excel tools.
